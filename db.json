In the 1950s WG Graham took over the shop and renamed it WG Graham's HiFi Corner. Upon his retirement, Graham Tiso bought the business and modernized the name to HiFi Horizon.\n\nSoon thereafter a young enthusiastic Colin MacKenzie (left), who was recommended by Linn's own Ivor Tiefenbrun, was employed to manage the shop; with a knack for business and years of experience in the hi-fi industry, Colin would later become the owner of HiFi Horizon.\n\nToday, Struan MacKenzie carries on the legacy as the company's Managing Director."
